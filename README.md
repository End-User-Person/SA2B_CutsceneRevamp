# SA2B_CutsceneRevamp
Did you know that SA2's cutscenes aren't supposed to look dull?

This mod aims to correct visual and audio errors with the cutscenes in Sonic Adventure 2: Battle and implement bonus features such as alternate animations and the original DC intro for the game.

So far, the mod
-Edits all cutscenes to fix various visual and audio errors
-Implements toggles for the DC intro, alterations to the Hero Intro (E0000), and the appearances of Sonic and Amy
-Enables full widescreen support for scenes that were forced into 4:3 (optional)
